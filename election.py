'''
Contains all the functions to generate ballots, calculate winner, detect draws
and zeros. Finally it runs a simulation with a hard-coded number of voters and
number of elections (simulations)

Definitions of essential terms
----------
"Individual voter"
    one single voter that casts their ballot based on the distance between
    them and the candidate.
"A group of voters"
    a collection of multiple of individual voters centered around a given mean
"A set of a voting group"
    a collection of multiple of group of voters

# Draw checker
def draw_checker(list_of_votes, max_pos): ##
    '''
    Check if there is a draw or zero by raising exceptions

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_of_votes: np.array
        Total number of votes for each candidate
    max_pos: int
        Position of the maximum number in list, equal to position of candidate

    Returns
    -------
    NoReturn
        This function only raises draw or zero exceptions

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroException
        The total number of votes for every single candidate is zero
    DrawException
        There are at least two candidates with the same number of votes
    NoDrawException
